Develop an immutable class Polynomial (polynomial) for working with polynomials of degree from one variable of real type (as an internal structure for storing coefficients use sz-array). For a developed class, redefine the virtual methods of the Object class; overload operations that are allowed to work with polynomials (excluding dividing the polynomial into a polynomial), including "==" and "! =". Develop unit-tests (NUnit framework).

Implement the method of "bubble" sorting of the integer array ("jagged" array) (do not use the methods of the System.Array! Class) so that you can order the rows of the matrix:
- in the order of increasing (decreasing) sums of elements of rows of the matrix;
- in order of increasing (decreasing) the maximum elements of rows of the matrix;
- in order of increasing (decreasing) the minimum elements of rows of the matrix.
